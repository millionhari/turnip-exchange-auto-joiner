# Turnip Exchange Auto Joiner
This script will auto-join rooms in turnip.exchange.

Instructions
============
- Pick a room on https://turnip.exchange/islands
- Open the Chrome dev console (cmd + option + j on Mac and ctrl + shift + j on Windows) and paste in the `turnip-exchange-auto-joiner.js` code
- Replace the `IN_GAME_NAME` AND `ISLAND_NAME` constants with your Animal Crossing in-game-name and island name
- Press enter and let the script do its work

Recommendations
===============
- I highly recommend you to join https://discordapp.com/channels/695018916279484477/695376591156412536, which posts rooms as soon as people post them on turnip.exchange. Use that discord in conjunction with this auto-joiner for a good stonks sesh.

NOTE: You will have to paste this into every room you want to join. This bot is extremely fast, BUT there is a slim chance that someone will still beat you to join the room. If that is the case, refresh the page and paste this code again!
