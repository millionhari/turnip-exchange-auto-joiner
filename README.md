# Turnip Exchange Auto Joiner
This script will auto-join rooms in turnip.exchange.

Instructions
============
- Pick a room on https://turnip.exchange/islands
- Open the dev console (cmd + shift + j) and paste in the `turnip-exchange-auto-joiner.js` code
- Replace the `IN_GAME_NAME` AND `ISLAND_NAME` constants with your Animal Crossing in-game-name and island name
- Press enter and let the script do its work

NOTE: You will have to paste this into every room you want to join. This bot is extremely fast, BUT there is a slim chance that someone will still beat you to join the room. If that is the case, refresh the page and paste this code again!
